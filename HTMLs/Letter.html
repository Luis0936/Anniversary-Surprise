A whole year has passed now, it feels so strange. It feels like time has passed so quickly and at the same time, also feels like we've been together longer hehe. Wether it was days were we both waking up to great mornings of hearing the other in our ears or keeping each other happy in our low points, we were always spending time with each other. Its safe to say, we want nothing but joy for each other within our hearts through the thick of life.

<p class="Letter"> Of course, the peak of this year was when I visited you for the first time. To say "I want to visit you," then actually doing it at the time is still crazy to me since I just decided to leave the whole country when I never left the state. The trip was more than special. The glimpse of being with you in person, being so cuddly, having moments where either of us could be wild and do fun things with each other or be chilling in the couch and giving each other scratchies...it was like living a dream. One I want to continue living. I knew reality was gonna set in once I left which was painful, but I know that at some point, there doesn't have to be a goodbye, and that fills me with lots of joy and hope. There is still some time away before anything like that will be set in motion since not only do I need to change the financial situation I am in and get a handle on my own struggles with myself, but being with you, it rooted a deep seeded want to be at that point and I will hold onto to that. You let me into your heart a year ago and I am still happy to be part of it my love! Here is to more happy times together!
