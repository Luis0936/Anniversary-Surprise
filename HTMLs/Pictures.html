            <p>I knew one of the perfect images to do for our anniversary was to continue this dance since it was one of the first things we started doing together. It was a mix of both you and me combining ideas and effort and I thought it was nice to do a tranistion of it for this year hehe~

        I felt like so many things aligned so well for an amazing day. You surprising me and taking me to your little own location and showing me a place that had significance to you made the day extremely special.

This last one is a memory that still persists even in my dreams...it was a moment that I could still vividly recall in detail. Its not hard with it still being recent, but I think it will still be stuck in my mind for so much longer and I couldn't be happier that it will.
